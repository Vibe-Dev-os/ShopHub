PLACEHOLDER IMAGE NOTICE
========================

The file "no-image.png" is currently empty and serves as a placeholder.

To add a proper "no image" placeholder:

Option 1: Use an online placeholder service
- The application will automatically fall back to showing a placeholder
- You can use services like placeholder.com or via.placeholder.com

Option 2: Create your own placeholder image
1. Create a 400x400px image with text "No Image Available"
2. Save it as "no-image.png" in this directory
3. Replace the empty file

Option 3: Download a free placeholder
1. Visit websites like unsplash.com or pixabay.com
2. Download a generic "no image" placeholder
3. Resize to 400x400px
4. Save as "no-image.png"

Recommended Specifications:
- Size: 400x400 pixels
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Background: Light gray (#f0f0f0)
- Text: "No Image Available" or similar
- File size: < 50KB

The application will work without this image, but having a proper placeholder
improves the user experience when products don't have images uploaded.
